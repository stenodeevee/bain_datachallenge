# Bain Data Challenge
Data Challenge, organized by The Nature Conservancy and BAIN, where I was awarded the most viability price.
You will see in this repository a data preprocessing and feature engineering file and a model testing and selection. The data was not included since I couldn't find the time to sanitize it.
